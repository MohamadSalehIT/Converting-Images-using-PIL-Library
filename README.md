# Converting-Images-using-PIL-Library

 We have a directory containing images in the wrong format ,  rotated 90Â° and too large(192x192). To fix this , we will write a simple script that will use  PIL(Python Image Library) to rotate the images to the right place, resize them from 192x192 to 128x128 , and convert them to JPEG format and then place them in a new directory
